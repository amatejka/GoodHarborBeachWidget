# GoodHarborBeachWidget

Widget that displays the tide times, heights, water temperature, sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset, and moonphase for the current and next day.

This is the bare python code, I created a batch file to open it easily from my desktop.

Uses python to scrape https://www.surf-forecast.com/breaks/Good-Harbor-Beach/tides/latest
